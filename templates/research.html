        <h2>Gender Bias in
        AI: <a href='https://github.com/gofilipa/trans_bias'>Anti-Trans
        Legislation</a>
        and <a href='https://github.com/gofilipa/trans_bias'>homo-generator</a></h2>
        <p>
            These two projects use machine learning technology to examine
            gender bias in language.

	    The first project is a text classification model
	    fine-tuned from the
             <a href='https://translegislation.com/'>anti-trans
            legislation</a> that is currently proliferating across the
            US. From this legislation, which I scraped and processed
            from government records, I extract definitions for gender
            and related terms, with the goal of scoring language about
            gender on a scale from affirming to non-affirming.

	    The second project is a text generation model, the
	    "homo-generator," fine-tuned on the
	    <a href='https://homosaurus.org/'>Homosaurus
	    vocabulary</a>.

        </p>

	<p> Both projects are still in development, and you

        for Working with Text</a></h2>
        <p>
            This online workshop series teaches Python programming
            from an ethical and feminist approach to working with text
            data. It begins with foundations of programming and
            proceeds to data gathering (with web scraping), and text
            analysis. Future units are currently being developed on
            text generation with machine learning.

        <p>
            My dissertation, <i>"Since No Expressions Do": Queer Tools
            for Studying Literature</i> explores how digital methods
            and tools for studying text engage with queer literature
            via Queer Studies frameworks. I critique digital methods
            and tools by exploring how computation, which
            disambiguates and fixes data for electronic processing,
            might be used to analyze the complexity of queerness
            expressed in textual style, form, and voice.

        <h2>Queer Distant Reading (<a href='https://github.com/gofilipa/qdr'>qdr</a>)</h2>
        <p>
            This project draws connections between programming logics
            and gender theory to propose a text analysis methodology
            that iterates through distant and close reading. Using
            Virginia Woolf's novel, <i>Orlando: A Biography</i>
            (1928), as a test case, I demonstrate how this method of
            text analysis leads from a binary understanding of gender
            into a plurality of gender significations in the novel,
            suggesting how language and gender are mutually
            constructed.

        <h2>Queer Text Encoding (<a href='https://github.com/gofilipa/qte'>qte</a>)</h2>
        <p>
            This project uses the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)
            standard, an electronic editing tool, to encode the
            homoerotic elements that Oscar Wilde edited while
            composing his novel, <i>The Picture of Dorian
            Gray</i>. (1890). It explores the mutually reinforcing
            nature of TEI's hierarchical structure and of dominance
            structures in archival data and practices.
